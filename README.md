The project started as a fun diy anniversary gift idea, a extra way of showing love. I quickly decided to make it more like a product instead of a one of thing, main reason being to learn more about the process. This has resulted in more focus on scalability and how it would work with multiple users and multiple devices of the same sort and of future devices.

The project consists of three main parts: A front-end mobile app created with react native, a backend server made using spring-boot and the physical device itself based around the esp32 microcontroller.
